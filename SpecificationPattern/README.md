# The Specification Pattern

## The goals
- Avoid domain knowledge duplication (achieve DRY)
- Declarative Approach (increase maintainability of code base)
- Encapsulate domain knowledge in a unit (or specification) to reuse across code base

## Main use cases
- In-memory validation (for example does a user input meet a specification)
- Retrieving data from a database (finding records that match a specification)
- Object construction (creating new objects that comply with a specification)
